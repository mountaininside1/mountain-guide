# mountain-guide
I am Ionuț Manea, the founder of the “Mountain Inside” project:
- AGMR aspiring mountain guide
- CNFM accredited ski instructor 2017
- Active military officer - mountain troops, with over a decade of experience in executing and leading specific actions of alpine instruction, mountaineering, tactical instruction and search and rescue in the mountain environment.

Created in 2017, “Mountain Inside” is the personal empowerment project through adventure actions carried out in the mountain environment and in adjacent areas, while minimizing the risks inherent to these actions.

Through this project, I choose to share the love of mountains and the amazing opportunities and experiences that mountains offer with open-minded people, who want liberation from the strange and information-oversaturated society in which we live and reconnect with themselves and others, through the mountains and nature.

Mission:
Transforming participants (including parents, children and adolescents) into healthier, better and more connected people with themselves and others, through the following activities carried out in the mountain environment and in nature, throughout the year:

1. Rock climbing

2. Guided mountaineering, carpathian and adventure trails

3. Mountain orienteering & navigation

4. Mountain running

5. Camping and folk music

6. Survival

7. Ski touring

8. Ski mountaineering

9. Team-building

The purpose of these activities is defined by the following:

1. Physical and psycho-emotional training for harmonious development and for building and strengthening general health

2. Reconnecting with oneself, others and nature

3. Cultivating self-knowledge, self-discipline and willpower by overcoming the challenges that arise

4. Cultivating the free spirit of the participants to break free from technology and crowding (contrary to the direction of current society) and to manifest healthily in nature.

5. Carrying out all activities in a stable and safe environment.

"Climb your mountain and you'll become one!"
